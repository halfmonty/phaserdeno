# Phaser By Example - Typescript

A conversion of the examples from the 'Phaser By Example' book to Typecript using the most recent phaser v4 api's with various fixes and correction due to errors in the book and bitrot over time. I've used the Deno runtime for a clean, typescript-friendly development environment.

### Prerequisites

Install the [Deno runtime](https://deno.com/). 

```powershell
# Windows
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```
```sh
# Max/Linux
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

### To Run
```bash
deno run dev
```
